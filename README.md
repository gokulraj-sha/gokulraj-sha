## Hi, I’m Gokul Raj 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer with a strong focus on Data Engineering**, experienced in building
backend services and data-intensive pipelines on AWS.

I work primarily with **Python and SQL**, and I have hands-on experience designing,
developing, and optimizing **ETL pipelines** using **PySpark, AWS Glue, Athena, and
Step Functions**. I also build **RESTful backend services using Django**, with a focus on
clean architecture, maintainable code, and real-world problem solving.

My work spans the full data lifecycle — from **data ingestion and transformation**
to **analytics-ready datasets and backend system integration**.

I’m currently seeking **entry-level opportunities** as a:
- **Data Engineer**
