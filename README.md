## Hi, I'm Gokul Raj 👋

Data Engineer and Software Engineer with hands-on experience in building cloud-native
ETL pipelines and backend applications. I have worked on designing and developing
scalable data workflows on AWS using Python, SQL, and PySpark, along with building
REST-based backend services using Django.

I have a strong foundation in software engineering, debugging, and data-driven
problem solving. I am comfortable working across the full development lifecycle —
from data ingestion, transformation, and validation to analytics-ready outputs
and backend system integration.

Actively seeking entry-level opportunities as a **Data Engineer**, **Software Engineer**,
or **Data Analyst**, where I can contribute to data-driven and scalable systems.
